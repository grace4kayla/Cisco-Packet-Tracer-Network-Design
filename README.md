# PacketTracer
Our CMPG315 project includes designing a budget-friendly network for a companyâ€™s new office using Cisco Packet Tracer and creating a portable Windows messaging app. The app will facilitate internet-based communication without installation. Deliverables are the network design, app, and documentation.
